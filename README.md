# THE DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE TASK THAT I HAVE DONE
# This interactive dashboard is about the datset superstore. As i have created three interactive dashboard and storyboard of this dashboard.

# Dashboard 1 – Profit by Region, Product, and Trend Over Time
# A bar chart shows profit by product and region, helping identify top-performing and low-performing zones. A line chart displays the profit trend over time, showing fluctuations across months and years. This enables the business to monitor growth patterns, spot seasonal dips, and analyze which regions consistently contribute higher profits. Certain products in regions like the West or Central may be highly profitable. Profit drops during specific months indicate possible discount-heavy seasons or poor sales strategies

#  Dashboard 2 – Sales by Category, Region, and Sales Trend
# A stacked bar chart visualizes sales by category and region, showing how each category performs across geographies. A line chart illustrates sales trends over time, helping identify peak seasons. The dashboard includes filters for category, region, and time to provide deeper user exploration. Categories like Technology and Office Supplies often lead in sales. The South or East regions may show growth over time but lag behind the West in volume.

# Dashboard 3 – Sales and Profit by Category, Region, and Profit Margin
# Dual bar charts showing both sales and profit by category and region. A calculated profit margin metric by category, indicating profitability percentage-wise rather than total volume. This combination allows clear identification of not just where revenue comes from, but also where profitability is most efficient. A category may have high sales but poor margins (e.g., Furniture), suggesting a need for pricing review. High-margin, low-sales categories (like Copiers) may represent untapped opportunities.

# Storyboard – Complete Business Insight Narrative
# To tie the dashboards together, a Tableau Storyboard was created. It walks the user through overall profit trends and regional comparison. Sales distribution across product categories and timelines 
# Combined sales, profit, and margin performance
# The West region leads in both sales and profit. Technology shows consistent high performance in both sales and margins. High discounts may negatively impact profit in certain categories. Strategic focus should be placed on growing high-margin segments while improving weak regions.
# The storyboard provides a structured narrative, transforming raw data into actionable insights and guiding viewers through a compelling data story.
